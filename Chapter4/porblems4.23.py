#Braking distance
# When you brake your car with your brand new tyres, your
# acceleration is 5 m/s2. (a) Find an expression for the distance you need to stop the car as a function of the
# starting velocity.
# 4.2 Calculation of Motion 77
# With your old tires, the acceleration is only two thirds of the acceleration with the
# new tyres.
# (b) How does this affect the braking distance?
# (c) Your reaction time is 0.5 s. If a child jumps into the street 30 m ahead of you
# when you are driving 50 km/h, are you able to stop with your new tires? What would
# happen if you did not change tyres?
